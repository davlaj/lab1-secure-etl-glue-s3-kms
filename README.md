# Lab 1 ‚Äì Secure ETL Pipeline with AWS Glue, S3, IAM, KMS and QuickSight

## üß† Context

This lab simulates a real-world scenario where a healthcare company ("HealthPlus") needs to securely process and analyze sensitive medical data using AWS-native tools. The pipeline must respect data privacy, security, and regulatory best practices, while preparing the data for analytical dashboards.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Ingest raw sensitive data stored in S3
- Clean and transform it with AWS Glue
- Secure storage using encryption at rest (KMS)
- Apply IAM policies following the principle of least privilege
- Log all operations for auditability
- Build a visual dashboard in Amazon QuickSight

## üß∞ AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3**: Raw and processed data storage
- **AWS KMS**: Encryption key for sensitive output
- **AWS IAM**: Fine-grained permissions and service roles
- **AWS Glue**: ETL pipeline (crawler + job)
- **AWS CloudTrail & CloudWatch**: Logging and auditing
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Final dashboard and reporting

## üß™ Lab Blocks

This lab is divided into short blocks.

### ‚úÖ Block 1 ‚Äî Environment Setup
- [x] Create S3 buckets (`raw`, `processed`)
- [x] Create a custom symmetric KMS key
- [x] Upload encrypted patient data (CSV) with SSE-KMS
- [x] Define IAM role for AWS Glue with least privilege
- [x] Enable CloudTrail and configure audit log S3 bucket

### ‚è≥ Block 2 ‚Äî ETL Pipeline
- [x] Create Glue Crawler for raw dataset
- [x] Create PySpark Glue Job for cleaning & transformation
- [x] Write output to encrypted S3 bucket (`processed`)

### ‚è≥ Block 3 ‚Äî Validation and Audit
- [x] **Check encryption (SSE-KMS or SSE-S3) is applied on data at rest**  
  Executed audit script `cli/audit_s3_encryption.sh`:  
    - `lab1-raw-data-david` uses **SSE-KMS** with custom KMS Key.  
    - `lab1-processed-data-david` uses **SSE-S3** with AES-256 encryption by default.  

- [x] **Validate Glue Catalog and schema**  
  Executed audit script `cli/audit_glue_catalog.sh` to:
    - List all tables in the `lab1_glue_db` database.  
    - Confirm the processed dataset table exists and the schema matches expectations.

- [X] **Enable and inspect CloudTrail (S3 access, KMS usage, IAM activity)**  
    - Ensure CloudTrail is enabled.  
    - Verify S3, KMS, and IAM events are being logged by running test activities and checking logs.

- [x] **Set retention policy for CloudTrail + cost-efficient log storage**  
    - Navigate to CloudWatch ‚Üí Log groups ‚Üí Select CloudTrail log group.  
    - Set a retention policy (e.g., 30 days) to minimize cost while retaining necessary audit data.

- [x] **Inspect logs in CloudWatch Logs (Glue Job runtime)**  
    - Navigate to CloudWatch ‚Üí Log groups.  
    - Inspect recent log streams related to Glue jobs and CloudTrail.  

### ‚è≥ Block 4 ‚Äî Visualization with QuickSight
- [ ] Connect QuickSight to processed dataset
- [ ] Create visuals (age, country, condition, map)
- [ ] Apply row-level access controls (if needed)

## üí∏ Cost Protection & Monitoring

This project was conducted in a personal AWS account with all billing safety mechanisms enabled:

- ‚úÖ **Budget Alerts**:
  - `Zero-Spend Budget`: alerts when costs exceed $0.01
  - `Monthly Budget`: $5/month soft limit with email alerts at 85% and 100%
  
- ‚úÖ **Anomaly Detection Monitor**:
  - Name: `aws-lab-anomaly-monitor`
  - Monitors total monthly spend at the account level
  - Uses Amazon SNS for immediate alerting in case of spending spikes

- ‚úÖ **Manual Cleanup Script**:
  - All lab resources are cleaned up with [`delete_all_lab1_resources.sh`](cli/delete_all_lab1_resources.sh)

These safeguards ensure full cost transparency and control throughout the lab process.

---

## üí∏ Security

This lab enforces production-grade security and cost governance:

- ‚úÖ Budget alerts and cost anomaly detection are enabled
- ‚úÖ Raw data is encrypted at rest using KMS (SSE-KMS) when uploaded from on-premise to S3
- ‚úÖ Default bucket encryption (SSE-S3) is applied to the processed data bucket
- ‚úÖ IAM roles and policies are auto-generated with strict least-privilege rules
- ‚úÖ KMS keys are reused safely unless explicitly deleted
- ‚úÖ Glue jobs run in isolated, AWS-managed infrastructure with in-transit encryption (TLS) and encrypted temporary storage
- ‚úÖ While in-memory data during Glue job execution is not encrypted (by design), it is processed securely within AWS Glue‚Äôs isolated environment, which is compliant with SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR

See [`audit/`](logs/session_notes.md) the verification steps used to ensure encryption and access compliance.
