# Lab 1 ‚Äì Secure ETL Pipeline with AWS Glue, S3, IAM, KMS and QuickSight

## üß† Context

This lab simulates a real-world scenario where a healthcare company ("HealthPlus") needs to securely process and analyze sensitive medical data using AWS-native tools. The pipeline must respect data privacy, security, and regulatory best practices, while preparing the data for analytical dashboards.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Ingest raw sensitive data stored in S3
- Clean and transform it with AWS Glue
- Secure storage using encryption at rest (KMS)
- Apply IAM policies following the principle of least privilege
- Log all operations for auditability
- Build a visual dashboard in Amazon QuickSight

## üß∞ AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3**: Raw and processed data storage
- **AWS KMS**: Encryption key for sensitive output
- **AWS IAM**: Fine-grained permissions and service roles
- **AWS Glue**: ETL pipeline (crawler + job)
- **AWS CloudTrail & CloudWatch**: Logging and auditing
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Final dashboard and reporting

## üß™ Lab Blocks

This lab is divided into short blocks.

### ‚úÖ Block 1 ‚Äî Environment Setup
- [x] Create S3 buckets (`raw`, `processed`)
- [x] Upload anonymized patient data (CSV)
- [x] Create a custom symmetric KMS key
- [x] Define IAM role for AWS Glue with least privilege

### ‚è≥ Block 2 ‚Äî ETL Pipeline
- [ ] Create Glue Crawler for raw dataset
- [ ] Create PySpark Glue Job for cleaning & transformation
- [ ] Write output to encrypted S3 bucket

### ‚è≥ Block 3 ‚Äî Validation and Audit
- [ ] Check KMS encryption
- [ ] Validate Glue Catalog
- [ ] Inspect logs (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)

### ‚è≥ Block 4 ‚Äî Visualization with QuickSight
- [ ] Connect QuickSight to processed dataset
- [ ] Create visuals (age, country, condition, map)
- [ ] Apply row-level access controls (if needed)

## üí∏ Cost Protection & Monitoring

This project was conducted in a personal AWS account with all billing safety mechanisms enabled:

- ‚úÖ **Budget Alerts**:
  - `Zero-Spend Budget`: alerts when costs exceed $0.01
  - `Monthly Budget`: $5/month soft limit with email alerts at 85% and 100%
  
- ‚úÖ **Anomaly Detection Monitor**:
  - Name: `aws-lab-anomaly-monitor`
  - Monitors total monthly spend at the account level
  - Uses Amazon SNS for immediate alerting in case of spending spikes

- ‚úÖ **Manual Cleanup Script**:
  - All lab resources are cleaned up with [`delete_all_lab1_resources.sh`](cli/delete_all_lab1_resources.sh)

These safeguards ensure full cost transparency and control throughout the lab process.
