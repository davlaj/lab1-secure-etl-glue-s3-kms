# Lab 1 – Secure ETL Pipeline with AWS Glue, S3, IAM, KMS and QuickSight

## 🧠 Context

This lab simulates a real-world scenario where a healthcare company ("HealthPlus") needs to securely process and analyze sensitive medical data using AWS-native tools. The pipeline must respect data privacy, security, and regulatory best practices, while preparing the data for analytical dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ingest raw sensitive data stored in S3
- Clean and transform it with AWS Glue
- Secure storage using encryption at rest (KMS)
- Apply IAM policies following the principle of least privilege
- Log all operations for auditability
- Build a visual dashboard in Amazon QuickSight

## 🧰 AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3**: Raw and processed data storage
- **AWS KMS**: Encryption key for sensitive output
- **AWS IAM**: Fine-grained permissions and service roles
- **AWS Glue**: ETL pipeline (crawler + job)
- **AWS CloudTrail & CloudWatch**: Logging and auditing
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Final dashboard and reporting

---

## 🧪 Lab Blocks

This lab is divided into short blocks.

### ✅ Block 1 — Environment Setup
- [x] Create S3 buckets (`raw`, `processed`)
- [x] Create a custom symmetric KMS key
- [x] Upload encrypted patient data (CSV) with SSE-KMS
- [x] Define IAM role for AWS Glue with least privilege
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail and configure audit log S3 bucket

### ⏳ Block 2 — ETL Pipeline
- [ ] Create Glue Crawler for raw dataset
- [ ] Create PySpark Glue Job for cleaning & transformation
- [ ] Write output to encrypted S3 bucket (`processed`)

### ⏳ Block 3 — Validation and Audit
- [ ] Check KMS encryption is applied on output files
- [ ] Validate Glue Catalog and schema
- [ ] Inspect logs in **CloudWatch Logs** (Glue Job runtime)
- [ ] Enable and inspect **CloudTrail** (S3 access, KMS usage, IAM activity)
- [ ] Set retention policy for CloudTrail + cost-efficient log storage

### ⏳ Block 4 — Visualization with QuickSight
- [ ] Connect QuickSight to processed dataset
- [ ] Create visuals (age, country, condition, map)
- [ ] Apply row-level access controls (if needed)

## 💸 Cost Protection & Monitoring

This project was conducted in a personal AWS account with all billing safety mechanisms enabled:

- ✅ **Budget Alerts**:
  - `Zero-Spend Budget`: alerts when costs exceed $0.01
  - `Monthly Budget`: $5/month soft limit with email alerts at 85% and 100%
  
- ✅ **Anomaly Detection Monitor**:
  - Name: `aws-lab-anomaly-monitor`
  - Monitors total monthly spend at the account level
  - Uses Amazon SNS for immediate alerting in case of spending spikes

- ✅ **Manual Cleanup Script**:
  - All lab resources are cleaned up with [`delete_all_lab1_resources.sh`](cli/delete_all_lab1_resources.sh)

These safeguards ensure full cost transparency and control throughout the lab process.

---

## 💸 Security

This lab enforces production-grade security and cost governance:

- ✅ Budget alerts and cost anomaly detection are enabled
- ✅ KMS is used for encryption at rest on both raw and processed data buckets
- ✅ All sensitive data is encrypted upon upload with `--sse-kms`
- ✅ IAM roles and policies are auto-generated with strict least-privilege rules
- ✅ Keys are reused safely unless explicitly deleted
